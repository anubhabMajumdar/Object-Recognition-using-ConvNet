# Object-Recognition-using-ConvNet
Object recognition using deep ConvNet and Caltch-256 dataset

This project is my first foray in learning and implementating deep convolutional neural network using Tensorflow.

Files
--------------------------
1. vcl_setup.sh - Run it to setup tensorflow with GPU support and all important python packages in Ubuntu machine
2. The read_image files returns an array of grayscale images. Modify these files to provide desired input.
3. cnn_*.py - All of these files have a different CNN architecture. cnn_1.py and cnn_2.py is deprecated.
